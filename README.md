### Project Report: Student Admission Management System

#### 1. Introduction
The Student Admission Management System is a web application designed to streamline the university admission process. This system facilitates online application submission, document upload, application status tracking, and data management. The project aims to simplify the admission process for both applicants and administrators, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.

#### 2. Project Objectives
- **Applicant Features:**
  - Online application submission
  - Document upload
  - Application status tracking

- **Administrator Features:**
  - Review and approval/rejection of applications
  - Data management
  - Report generation

#### 3. Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Java Servlets, JSP
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Server:** Red Hat, JBoss
- **Framework:** Hibernate

#### 4. System Design

**4.1. Architecture**
The system follows a client-server architecture with a multi-tier structure:
- **Presentation Layer:** Handles the user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Manages application processing using Java Servlets and JSP.
- **Data Access Layer:** Interacts with the MySQL database using Hibernate for data persistence.

**4.2. Database Design**
The database consists of the following tables:
- **applications:** Stores application data including username, full name, mobile number, email ID, gender, twelfth mark sheet link, branch, and status.
- **students:** Stores student records.
  
**4.3. Application Flow**
1. **User Registration and Login:**
   - Users can sign up and log in to the system.
   - Authentication is managed through a `validateUser` method in the `StudentManager` class.
   
2. **Application Submission:**
   - Applicants fill out an application form with the following fields: username, sid, full name, mobile number, email ID, gender, resume (Google Drive link), cgpa, and status (default 'Pending').
   - The application data is submitted and stored in the `applications` table.
   
3. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Administrators can view all student applications.
   - Clicking on a student's application provides detailed information.
   - Administrators can approve or reject applications, updating the status field in the database.

#### 5. Implementation

**5.1. Application Form**
The application form is designed using Bootstrap for a responsive layout. It captures all necessary details and submits the data to the server for processing.

**5.2. Application Manager**
The `ApplicationManager` class handles CRUD operations for application data using Hibernate. It includes methods to insert, update, delete, and retrieve `Application` data.

**5.3. Servlet Handling**
Servlets manage the requests and responses between the client and server. Key servlets include:
- `UserDetailsServlet`: Returns JSON data with username and sid.
- `ApplicationServlet`: Manages application submissions and updates.

#### 6. Usage

**6.1. For Applicants**
- Register and log in to the system.
- Fill out the application form and submit it.
- Track the status of your application from your dashboard.

**6.2. For Administrators**
- Log in to the admin dashboard.
- View and manage student applications.
- Approve or reject applications and update the status.

#### 7. Conclusion
The Student Admission Management System is an efficient tool for managing university admissions. It simplifies the application process for students and provides administrators with robust tools for managing applications and generating reports. The use of modern web technologies ensures a smooth user experience and easy maintenance.

#### 8. Future Enhancements
- **Email Notifications:** Send email alerts to applicants regarding their application status.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Incorporate analytics to track application trends and statistics.
- **User Role Management:** Enhance the system to support multiple admin roles with varying permissions.
